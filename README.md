## Final Notes

Using selfbots is not officially supported by Discord. If you do something stupid, you _can_ get your account banned completely. Additionally, many users find selfbots annoying or unsafe. Use a selfbot responsibly. Don't use it to spam or to intentionally annoy other users. Any actions you make with a selfbot fall solely on you. You can read the full Discord Terms of Service [here](https://discordapp.com/terms)

Using a bot with Discord Dungeon is also again TOS. I hold no responsibility for you getting banned.

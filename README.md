# Discord-Dungeon-Bot
Bot to automate Discord Dungeon


## DDBot

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Setup:

1. Download the latest release. 
2. Run the installer.bat
3. Input your information into the config.json
4. Run run.bat
5. In discord use "-help" to get list of commands

**Find your User Token.** In browser or desktop Discord, type `Ctrl-Shift-I`. Go to the Application section, and and go to **Storage** > **LocalStorage** > **discordapp.com**. Find the `token` row, and your token will be the value in quotes. **Do not share this token with anyone** This token provides complete access to your Discord account, so never share it!

**Find your OwnerID.** In Discord, go to **User Settings** > **Appearance** > Turn on Developer mode under Advanced. Now right click your name and right click your user name. Select copyID. Paste this into config as your userID.

## How to use
* '-help' shows usable commands
* '-forage' executes #!chop, #!mine, #!fish, #!forage every 300-350 seconds 10 times
* '-forage x' executes #!chop, #!mine, #!fish, #!forage every 300-350 seconds x times. x is an integer you enter. (ex. -forage 20)
* '-adv' executes #!adv 2 every 15-20 seconds 10 times (Watch your health!)
* '-adv x' executes #!adv 2 every 15-20 seconds x times. x is an integer you enter (Watch your health!)



## Final Notes

Using selfbots is not officially supported by Discord. If you do something stupid, you _can_ get your account banned completely. Additionally, many users find selfbots annoying or unsafe. Use a selfbot responsibly. Don't use it to spam or to intentionally annoy other users. Any actions you make with a selfbot fall solely on you. You can read the full Discord Terms of Service [here](https://discordapp.com/terms)

Using a bot with Discord Dungeon is also again TOS. I hold no responsibility for you getting banned. Do not use in official Discord Dungeon channel
